## Explain the Difference Between Git and GitHub
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It operates locally on your computer.
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaborative tools like pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD integration.
